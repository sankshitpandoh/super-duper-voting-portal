## Steps to Run:
This project used node server in bacground , the react app connects to it using a proxy.

- Install node modules / dependencies

    Inside Project Directory run

    ```
    npm install    
    ```

    This installs dependencies for node server first and then goes inside client directory and installs dependencies

    npm run dev
    ```

    This runs both the server and react app in a single terminal window (uses npm concurrently package to do this)
